# ecommerce-website-sales-analysis-using-Power-BI
This project involved analyzing e-commerce sales data using Jupyter Notebook and Power BI to segment customers using RFM analysis and create visualizations to identify opportunities for targeted customer marketing and cost savings.

Steps involved during working on project:

1.Cleaning the Data: I started by importing the sales data into Jupyter Notebook and cleaning it up by removing any duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant columns. This step is essential to ensure that the data is accurate and complete before performing any analysis.

2.RFM Analysis: Once the data is cleaned, used RFM analysis to segment  customers based on their purchasing behavior. RFM analysis stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value, and it's a powerful tool for identifying the most valuable customers and tailoring your marketing strategies accordingly. This analysis can help to identify who the best customers are, who needs attention, and who might be lost.

3.Exporting the Data to Power BI: After completing the RFM analysis in Jupyter Notebook, exported the cleaned data to Power BI. Power BI is a powerful tool for data visualization that enables us to create interactive reports and dashboards that showcase the insights generated from the data.

Creating Visualizations: In Power BI, created several visualizations to show the results of your RFM analysis. These visualizations included charts, graphs, and tables that highlight important metrics like customer purchase frequency, and average order value.
